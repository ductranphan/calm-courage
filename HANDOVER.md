# Calm Courage — Comprehensive Handover for Ashley / Incoming Developer

**Date:** 4 Sep 2026  
**Prepared for:** Ashley / next developer  
**Source of truth branch:** `duc`  
**Repo:** https://github.com/ductranphan/calm-courage  

---

## 0. Critical first facts

1. **Latest deployment-ready work is on GitHub branch `duc`**, not necessarily fully merged into `main`.
2. Local working tree on `duc` should be kept **clean and up to date with `origin/duc`**.
3. **Firebase backend for project `calm-courage-co` is already deployed** (rules + Cloud Functions).
4. **App Store / Google Play submission has not happened.**
5. **Do not treat Expo Go emulator testing as “app is broken”** — oversized SVG card assets commonly cause OOM / slow starts. Prefer EAS builds / real devices for QA.
6. **Never commit `.env`.** Keys live locally / in EAS secrets / password manager only.

- Phase 1 activity catalog (`src/constants/activities.ts`) with pillars/rewards
- Game hub → Phase 1 activity mapping via `GAME_HUB_ACTIVITY_IDS`
- Parent dashboard progress from completed Phase 1 activities
- Child stars/gems/badges via `useChildRewards` / child document fields
- Premium gating: activity/level **1 free**; **2+ require subscription** (`src/utils/premiumAccess.ts`)

---

## 2. Outstanding work — before the app is “ready”

### Must-have for public store launch

1. Hosted **HTTPS Privacy Policy** URL (+ paste into App Store / Play listings)
2. Optional hosted **Terms of Use** URL
3. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_TERMS_OF_USE_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` in EAS secrets
4. **Apple Developer** + **Google Play Console** access
5. EAS project link (`eas init` if needed) + cloud builds
6. Device QA / smoke tests (`PRODUCTION.md` §6)
7. **Real Apple/Google IAP** + receipt verification in Cloud Functions
8. Set `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SUBSCRIPTION_GRANT=false` on Functions before public release
9. Legal review of consent copy in `src/constants/consent.ts`
10. Asset performance fix (convert huge embedded-photo SVGs → PNG/WebP; load per card)

### Soft-launch / internal testing can proceed earlier with

- In-app Privacy Policy only
- QA paywall (Face ID simulation → `activateSubscription` without store receipt)
- TestFlight / Play internal track

---

## 3. Development tasks remaining

### High priority (engineering)

| Task | Why |
|------|-----|
| Replace paywall Face ID simulation with StoreKit / Play Billing | Required for real money + App Review |
| Implement receipt verification in `functions/index.js` (TODO already marked) | Stop unverified entitlement grants |
| Convert Emotion Match + Scenario SVGs to optimized PNG/WebP | ~143MB + ~50MB of giant SVGs cause Expo Go crashes / huge bundles |
| Lazy-load / split other heavy screens if needed (workbook, rewards SVGs, roleplay) | Startup stability |
| Wire `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` into EAS production env/secrets | Store builds need Firebase config |
| Confirm password-reset ActionCodeSettings + authorized domains in Firebase Auth | Deep links must open app |
| Merge `duc` → `main` via PR when company is ready | Keep default branch current |
| Clean ESLint / React Compiler issues (pre-existing in several screens) | Quality; not currently blocking builds |

### Medium / later

| Task | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Social login (Google/Apple/Facebook) | Explicitly hidden; “coming soon” on create-account |
| Push notification **sender** Cloud Function | Client registration helper exists (`pushRegistration.ts`); no sender Function yet |
| Phase 2 child path content | UI shows “[ Phase 2 - Coming Soon ]” |
| Stronger VPC methods if product expands | Credit card / ID verification not in V1 |
| Upgrade Functions runtime before Node 20 decommission (Firebase warned Oct 2026) | Deploy warning already seen |
| Upgrade `firebase-functions` package when ready | Deploy warned outdated |

---

## 4. Testing and known bugs / issues

### Known / expected issues

1. **Expo Go / Android emulator crash or kick-back after bundle**
   - Cause: multi‑MB SVG “images” imported as React components (Emotion Match ~40 files ~143MB; Scenarios ~20 files ~50MB).
   - Mitigation started: lazy routes for those screens + lighter startup preload.
   - Residual risk: still huge on first open of those games; emulator RAM limited.

2. **First Metro bundle after `--clear` is very slow** (often 30–90s+). Normal for this asset-heavy repo.

3. **Paywall “purchase” is QA-only** — Face ID sheet simulates success and calls Cloud Function; not a real store charge.

4. **Subscription grants can be unverified** while `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SUBSCRIPTION_GRANT` ≠ `"false"`.

5. **ESLint reports many React Compiler / hooks warnings** in screens like `confidence-quest-card`, `children`, scenario card. Pre-existing; app still bundles.

6. **Web export** is not a primary target; native-only modules (e.g. pager-view) can fail on web.

7. **Local `main` may be behind `origin/main`** on some machines; always pull remotes and use **`duc`** for this workstream.

### Smoke test checklist (must run on real build)

From `PRODUCTION.md` §6 (still unchecked):

- Cold start → age gate
- Under-13 → blocked screen
- Adult → onboarding → signup with 3 consents
- Verify email → PIN → create child
- Privacy Policy opens
- Daily emotion → encouragement
- Level 1 free; Level 2+ paywall
- Paywall activates trial via Cloud Function
- Forgot password → deep link → reset
- Contact Us creates `supportTickets`
- Delete child / delete account cascade

### Suggested QA environments

1. EAS `preview` build on physical Android
2. TestFlight on physical iPhone
3. Avoid relying solely on Expo Go + low-RAM emulator for final sign-off

---

## 5. Deployment — prepared vs remaining

### Already prepared / done

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Firebase project + Blaze (required for Functions) | In use |
| Firestore rules deployed | Done |
| Storage rules deployed | Done |
| Functions deployed (`activateSubscription`, `clearSubscription`) | Done |
| App IDs / schemes in `app.json` | Done |
| EAS config scaffolding | Done |
| Production checklist doc | `PRODUCTION.md` |
| Backend redeploy script | `npm run firebase:deploy` |

### Still to do for mobile store deployment

1. Company Apple + Google accounts
2. Expo account + `eas login` / `eas init`
3. Configure EAS secrets for all `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`
4. `eas build --profile preview` (internal) then `production`
5. `eas submit` to stores
6. Store listing assets (screenshots, description, age rating, privacy URL)
7. Turn off unverified subscription grants after real IAP

### Redeploy rules (important)

| Change type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| App UI / JS / assets only | Rebuild app / restart Expo — **no Firebase deploy** |
| `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` / `functions/` | `npm run firebase:deploy` |
| GitHub push alone | Does **not** update Firebase or stores |

---

## 6. App Store & Google Play — what Ashley needs from development

### Identifiers / config (dev-owned)

```text
iOS bundleIdentifier:     com.calmcourage.app
Android applicationId:    com.calmcourage.app
URL scheme:               calm-courage
Password reset deep link: calm-courage://reset-password  (and related auth action links)
Expo slug / name:         calm-courage / "Calm Courage"
EAS profiles:             development | preview | production  (eas.json)
```

### Env vars Ashley must have (never commit real values)

From `.env.example`:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` (= `calm-courage-co`)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_IOS_BUNDLE_ID` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_ANDROID_PACKAGE`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` (required for public listings)
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_TERMS_OF_USE_URL` (optional)
- `EXPO_ROUTER_IMPORT_MODE=lazy` (recommended for smaller startup)

Source for Firebase web config: **Firebase Console → Project settings → Your apps → Web app**.

### Store listing items company/legal must provide

- Public Privacy Policy URL (HTTPS)
- Support email / URL
- Marketing screenshots, description, keywords
- Age rating questionnaire answers (child-directed / parental control product)
- COPPA / kids category positioning decision with legal

### Technical steps for store builds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ductranphan/calm-courage.git
cd calm-courage
git checkout duc
npm install
npm run functions:install

npx eas-cli login
npx eas-cli init   # if not linked

# Set EAS secrets for EXPO_PUBLIC_* values, then:
npx eas-cli build --platform ios --profile preview
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview

# Later:
npx eas-cli build --platform all --profile production
npx eas-cli submit --platform all
```

### Firebase Auth settings Ashley should verify

- Email/Password provider enabled
- Authorized domains include what the app/reset emails need
- Password reset template continue URL compatible with `calm-courage://reset-password`

---

## 7. Database / backend status

### Live project

- **ID:** `calm-courage-co`
- **Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/calm-courage-co/overview
- **Owner historically used:** `hello@calmcourageco.ca` (confirm current IAM)

### Data model (high level)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `parents/{uid}` | Parent profile, consents, PIN hash, subscription entitlement fields |
| `parents/{uid}/children/{childId}` | Child profiles, rewards totals |
| `.../checkIns` | Emotion check-ins |
| `.../activityAttempts` | Activity/hub progress |
| `.../quests` | Quest board state |
| `.../media` | Child media metadata |
| `emotionPrompts/{id}` | Encouragement content (seedable; local fallback exists) |
| `supportTickets` | Contact Us (create-only for clients) |
| `accountDeletionFeedback` | Deletion feedback (create-only) |

### Security highlights

- Parent can only read/write own `parents/{uid}` tree
- Clients **cannot** set paid subscription fields; Functions write those
- Create parent: subscription only `trial` / null / absent

### Functions remaining work

- Receipt verification TODO in `functions/index.js`
- Before public launch: `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SUBSCRIPTION_GRANT=false`
- Optional: push sender Function
- Plan Node runtime upgrade before Node 20 sunset (~Oct 2026 warning)

### Seed script

```bash
npm run seed:emotion-prompts
# needs ADC / service account credentials
```

## 8. Games / features — completed vs outstanding

### Completed (V1 code present)

- Choose Your Courage scenarios (multi-level)
- Emotion Puzzle Match (multi-level)
- Roleplay challenges
- Confidence quests
- Quest Board
- Daily emotion + encouragement
- Digital workbook + recording
- Rewards screen
- Premium gate Level 2+
- Soft-launch entitlement activation

### Outstanding / partial

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Phase 2 adventure path | Placeholder only (“Coming Soon”) |
| Real IAP purchase flow | Not implemented (QA Face ID only) |
| Social login | Hidden / not wired |
| Remote push sending | Not implemented |
| Asset optimization for card decks | Critical follow-up |
| Some challenge “complete” paths / polish | Called out in `PRODUCTION.md` as post soft-launch |

---

## 9. Progress tracking / user functionality

### Working in code

- Parent dashboard progress % from Phase 1 activity completions
- Hub level completion persistence
- Stars / gems / badges on child profile
- Daily check-ins
- Activity attempt start/complete lifecycle
- Parent PIN session (in-memory; must re-enter after app restart)
- Active child selection (in-memory; cleared on account change)

### Remaining / watch-outs

- Confirm reward increments happen consistently on every hub completion path during QA
- Confirm Level 2+ always routes to paywall when entitlement inactive
- Confirm delete child / delete account cascades (Storage + Firestore) on a real backend account
- Parent progress “unavailable” states exist in UI — verify when no child / no attempts

---

## 10. Code / repository

### Location

```text
GitHub:  https://github.com/ductranphan/calm-courage
Branch:  duc   ← use this for latest deployment work
```

### Branch notes

- `main` exists and may differ; local `main` can be behind `origin/main`.
- `Negin` branch also exists (other contributor work).
- **Do not assume `main` has all COPPA/Firebase/EAS work until merged.** Prefer `duc`, then open PR → `main`.

### Clone quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ductranphan/calm-courage.git
cd calm-courage
git fetch origin
git checkout duc
git pull
npm install
npm run functions:install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill secrets
npx expo start --clear
```

## 11. Documentation / access / credentials to hand over

### Docs in repo

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `HANDOVER.md` | This document — operational continuity for Ashley |
| `PRODUCTION.md` | Full production/COPPA/EAS/smoke checklist |
| `.env.example` | Required env var names |
| `.firebaserc` / `.firebaserc.example` | Firebase project binding |
| `firebase.json` | Rules + functions deploy config |
| `eas.json` | Build/submit profiles |
| `functions/index.js` | Entitlement Functions + soft-launch notes |

### Access Ashley needs

1. GitHub repo (write)
2. Firebase / GCP project `calm-courage-co` (Editor/Owner as appropriate)
3. Expo/EAS account for the org
4. Apple Developer + App Store Connect (when company ready)
5. Google Play Console (when company ready)
6. Secure copy of `.env` values / EAS secrets (not via git)
7. Support inbox address for `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`
8. Final Privacy Policy URL from legal/marketing

### Do **not** hand over via chat/email in plain text if avoidable

- Firebase API keys are “public client” keys but still shouldn’t be dumped casually
- Any service-account JSON, keystores (`.jks`), `.p8`, provisioning profiles — password manager only
- Never commit those files (`.gitignore` already blocks many)

---

## 12. Everything else to continue smoothly (don’t start over)

### Mental model of the system

```text
Expo app (src/)
  → Firebase Auth / Firestore / Storage (client SDK)
  → Callable Cloud Functions for subscription writes only
  → EAS builds for installable iOS/Android
  → App Store / Play (not yet)
```

### Architecture gotchas

1. **Subscription fields are server-only.** If someone “fixes” the client to write `subscription: "monthly"` directly, Firestore rules will block it — by design.
2. **Parent access PIN is session memory only** — expected to re-prompt after kill/relaunch.
3. **Active child is session memory only.**
4. **Age gate adult clearance is local AsyncStorage**; under-13 years are not persisted.
5. **Heavy art is the #1 performance risk**, not Firebase. Fix assets before spending weeks on Expo Go emulator debugging.
6. **Soft-launch entitlements are intentionally loose** until IAP exists — don’t ship that to public production.
7. **Email-only auth for launch**; social buttons removed/hidden on purpose.
8. **Consent version string** must be bumped when legal text changes (`CONSENT_VERSION`).

### Suggested first week for Ashley

1. Get GitHub + Firebase + Expo access; clone `duc`.
2. Create local `.env`; run app on a physical device or EAS preview.
3. Walk `PRODUCTION.md` smoke tests against live `calm-courage-co`.
4. Confirm Functions + rules still match repo (`firebase deploy` only if drift).
5. Plan asset conversion for Emotion Match / Scenario cards.
6. Align with company on Privacy Policy URL + store account owners.
7. Open PR `duc` → `main` once validated.
8. Start StoreKit / Play Billing design with receipt verification in Functions.

### One-sentence status for leadership

> The Calm Courage V1 app and Firebase backend are largely built and the backend is live; remaining work is store accounts, privacy URL, real IAP, device QA, asset performance, and merging/releasing via EAS — not rebuilding the product from scratch.
